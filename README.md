# Calorie and Nutrition Tracker (Android)

## Concept
This Android app was developed as a final project for a mobile app course at Western Washington University. The app was made in a group of three completely from scratch, with each member taking on a specific 
development role. The goal was to make a full-stack Android mobile app in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. The app measures calories and micronutrients at a per-calorie level, or at a glance, thanks to the bar graphs of each fraction - no user math required! Food items are separated into different meal categories, each of which can have a manually entered meal, or if the food comes with a barcode it can be scanned for quick entry!
